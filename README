                       Semi  User Manual
                      Trevor Walker 1992

Semi is a computer implementation of the semigroup equivalent
of the Todd-Coxeter process for groups.   Given a presentation
for a finite semigroup, it returns the order of the semigroup.
Semi can also evaluate products, calculate ideals, take the
union , intersection and complement of sets and determine
whether a subset of a semigroup is a group.   The complete set
of available commands in version 2.1 is described below.

'e' command:   This command is used to enumerate a
            presentation.  A presentation  consists of a set
            of relations, each preceded by a slash (/).   A
            relation consists of two words separated by an
            equals (=) sign.   A word is a string of letters,
            digits and  parenthesis with the convention that
            where a number occurs it indicates that the
            immediately preceding item should be raised to
            that power.   Thus the presentation
            <a, b | a^3=a, b^6=b, (abab^4)^7ab^2a=b^2> would
            be entered as  /a3=a/b6=b/(abab4)7ab2a=b2.

'ef' command:      This command prompts for a file name and
            enumerates the presentation found in that file in
            the format described above.   It is intended to
            allow the editing of large presentations.

'i' command:This command prints a list of the idempotents of
            the semigroups that has been enumerated.

'l' command:This command prints a list of the elements of the
            semigroup.   If both the standard input and the
            standard output are terminals, this command prints
            its output one screenful at a time.  If either the
            standard input or the standard output is not a
            terminal then this command simply prints all of
            its output without pausing.

'w' command:This command evaluates a word.   The input format
            for a word is as for a presentation (see 'e'
            command above) with the addition of the convention
            that the string $n refers to element number n of
            the semigroup.   Element numbers are returned by
            many other commands in addition to the
            representation of the element as a word in the
            generators.

'dw' command:This command acts as the 'w' command above
            but explains in great detail how it arrives at its
            answer.   This can sometimes be helpful when you
            cannot see how to prove something that the program
            says is true!

'id' command:This command evaluates principal ideals.   It
            first prompts for the letters r,l or t and then
            for an element of the semigroup (in the same input
            format as for the 'w' command) and evaluates the
            principal ideal generated by that element.    Note
            that calculation of two-sided ideals in large
            semigroups can be very time-consuming.   If the
            current printing method is short form, this
            command will return only the element numbers of
            the elements of the ideal.   If the current
            printing method is long form then this command
            will also return expressions as words in the
            generators for each element of the ideal.   In
            either case this command may generate large
            quantities of output, so if both the standard
            input and standard output are terminals, this
            command will produce its output one screenful at a
            time.

'sf' and 'lf' commands: The 'sf' command requests output to
            be in short form while the 'lf' command requests
            long form output.   See the 'id' and 'ps' commands
            for details of exactly what effect these options
            have.

't' command:This command prints the multiplication table for
            the semigroup.   It both the standard input and
            standard output are terminals, this command will
            produce its output one screenful at a time,
            otherwise it just prints everything without
            pausing.

'tf' command:This command will print transformations
            representing elements of the semigroup.   The
            input format for elements is as for the 'w'
            command.   Transformation generators for the
            semigroup may be obtained by applying this command
            with the generators as arguments.

'ts' command:This command is used to alter the table size.
            The default table size is decided when the program
            is installed; unless otherwise specified at that
            time it is 5000000 integers.   Increasing the
            table size will allow the enumeration of larger
            semigroups but may degrade the performance of the
            machine on which the program is run, especially if
            it causes memory paging.

'se' command:This command solves equations of the form ax=b
            or xa=b. The input format for a and b is as for the 'w'
            command above.

'la' command:This command allows the user to specify
            additional points at which to perform lookaheads.
            The points specified are entered, separated by
            spaces, new lines or tabs and terminated by -1.

'cm' command:This command allows the user to select
            whether identities are queued, stacked or
            processed recursively.   The default is for
            identities to be stacked.

'st' command:This command allows the current subset (i.e.
            the result of the last set operation) to be stored
            in one of 32 numbered locations for later
            retrieval.

'rs' command:This command retrieves a previously stored
            subset of the semigroup.

'in' command:This command forms the intersection of the
            current subset with a subset previously stored
            with the 'st' command.

'un' command:This command forms the union of the current
            subset and a subset previously stored with the
            'st' command.

'gp' command:This command determines whether the current
            subset of the semigroup is a group.

'ps' command:This command prints the current subset of the
            semigroup.   It first prints the number of
            elements in the subset and then prints the
            elements themselves.   If short form printing is
            on (see the 'sf' and 'lf' commands) then it only
            prints element numbers for the elements, but if
            long form printing is on then it also prints their
            representations as words in the generators.   In
            either case, if the standard input and standard
            output are both terminals, then it produces its
            output one screenful at a time, otherwise it just
            prints everything without pausing.

'cp' command:This command forms the complement of the
            current subset of the semigroup.

'h' command:Limited on-line help is available by use of the
            'h' command; it produces a list of available
            commands with a one-line description of each.

'q' command:This command terminates the program and returns
            control to the operating system.
